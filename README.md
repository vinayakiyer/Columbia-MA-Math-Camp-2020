## Overview
This course provides an overview of the mathematical concepts needed for the first year Master's sequence in
economics; its goal is to prepare students for their first-year economics classes. Focus will be put on thinking
about and writing proofs as well as problem solving. Problem sets will be assigned weekly and due on Mondays.
Although these will be graded, no grade will be given for the class. There will be an exam covering the material
from math camp during the first meeting of the Math Methods course.

Lecture notes/ slides will be available on the course website, and the material presented in the course will
largely be self-contained. Students are expected to have taken courses in single-variable calculus, and some
familiarity with concepts in probability and linear algebra will be assumed, although we will spend some time
reviewing these topics.

Classes will meet every weekday from 9:30AM - 12PM, running from Monday, August 12th through Thursday,
August 29th. The course room is Hamilton 717. 


## Textbooks
The material from this course will primarily pull from two reference texts:
1. Essential Mathematics for Economic Analysis (5th Edition) by Knut Sydsæter, Peter Hammond, Arne
Strøm, and Andrés Carvajal
2. Further Mathematics for Economic Analysis (2nd Edition) by Knut Sydsæter, Peter Hammond, Atle
Seierstad and Arne Strøm

## Tentative Course Outline
1. Introduction to Set Theory 
2. Real Analysis 
3. Linear Algebra
4. Convexity
5. Multivariable Calculus and Optimization
